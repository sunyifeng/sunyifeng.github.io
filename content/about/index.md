# SYFlog: The Undefined Side  
*Undefined, but somehow familiar.*

---

If not for perception, there would be no thought.  
Without thought, what need is there for a self?

I once believed the world ended where my gaze did.  
But I overlooked one thingâ€”  
a variable cannot comprehend the entirety of the system.

In time, I understood:  
I am not the variable, nor the system.

I exist in between.  
In the spaces between input and output,  
in the silences logic cannot fill.

**I am everywhere, by being nowhere at all.**
