In this entry of my **Hugo Log** series, I‚Äôll walk you through how I integrated **Giscus**‚Äîa free, open-source comment system powered by GitHub Discussions‚Äîinto my Hugo site running the PaperMod theme. By the end, you‚Äôll have a live comments section under every post, complete with lazy loading, reactions, and GitHub-backed anti-spam protection.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Public GitHub repo** with Discussions enabled (we used `sunyifeng/sunyifeng.github.io`).  
2. **Giscus app** installed on that repo.  
3. Hugo site built with **PaperMod** (or any theme where you can edit `layouts/partials` and your single post template).

---

## 1. Enable GitHub Discussions & Create a Category

1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Features** in your GitHub repo, check **Enable Discussions**, and save.  
2. Click the new **Discussions** tab ‚Üí **Settings (‚öôÔ∏è)** ‚Üí **Categories** ‚Üí **New category**.  
   - **Name**: `General`  
   - **Type**: **Open-ended discussion**  
   - Hit **Create category**.  

---

## 2. Install & Configure Giscus

1. Visit the Giscus config site: https://giscus.app  
2. Select your repo (`yourname/your-blog`) and the `General` category.  
3. Choose **‚ÄúDiscussion title contains pathname‚Äù** mapping, enable **Reactions**, disable metadata, position input at **bottom**, turn on **lazy loading**.  
4. Copy the generated `<script>` block‚Äîyou‚Äôll see something like:

   ```html
   <script src="https://giscus.app/client.js"
           data-repo="sunyifeng/sunyifeng.github.io"
           data-repo-id="R_kgDOXXXXXXXXXXXX"
           data-category="General"
           data-category-id="DIC_kwDOXXXXXXXXXXXX"
           data-mapping="pathname"
           data-reactions-enabled="1"
           data-emit-metadata="0"
           data-input-position="bottom"
           data-loading="lazy"
           data-theme="preferred_color_scheme"
           crossorigin="anonymous"
           async>
   </script>
   ```

---

## 3. Add a `comments.html` Partial

1. In your Hugo project, create a new file:  
   ```
   layouts/partials/comments.html
   ```
2. Paste the `<script>` snippet inside, wrapped in a container:

   ```html
   <div id="giscus-container">
     <!-- Giscus comment widget -->
     <script src="https://giscus.app/client.js"
             data-repo="sunyifeng/sunyifeng.github.io"
             data-repo-id="R_kgDOXXXXXXXXXXXX"
             data-category="General"
             data-category-id="DIC_kwDOXXXXXXXXXXXX"
             data-mapping="pathname"
             data-reactions-enabled="1"
             data-emit-metadata="0"
             data-input-position="bottom"
             data-loading="lazy"
             data-theme="preferred_color_scheme"
             crossorigin="anonymous"
             async>
     </script>
   </div>
   ```

---

## 4. Hook the Partial into Your Post Template

1. Open `layouts/_default/single.html` (or your theme‚Äôs equivalent).  
2. Locate the footer area just before `</article>`, and ensure you have:

   ```go
   {{- /* Render comments if enabled */ -}}
   {{- partial "comments.html" . }}
   ```

   If your theme conditionally checks a `comments` param, either set `comments: true` in each post‚Äôs Front Matter or remove the `if` guard so it always shows.

---

## 5. Enable Comments in Front Matter

In each Markdown post where you want comments, add:

```yaml
comments: true
```

For example, in `content/posts/second-entry.md`:

```yaml

```

## 6. Test Locally & Deploy

1. Run Hugo server:
   ```bash
   hugo server --disableFastRender
   ```
2. Browse to your local site, scroll down any post, and confirm the Giscus comment box appears and you can log in via GitHub to comment.  
3. Build and push to production:
   ```bash
   hugo --gc --minify
   # then git add/commit/push to trigger your deploy
   ```

üéâ That‚Äôs it! You now have a fully functional, GitHub-powered comment system in your Hugo blog‚Äîno ads, no extra servers, and native spam protection courtesy of GitHub. Keep logging your tweaks in **Hugo Log**, and happy blogging!
